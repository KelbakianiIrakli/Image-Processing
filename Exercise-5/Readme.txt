In the process of identifying corresponding objects within an image using the Fourier transform, I observe  objects wth sharp edges in the image, and try to identify strong frequencies generated perpendicular to the prominent edges in the original image. These strong perpendicular frequencies can serve as distinctive markers for identification.
1. f identified strong edges near nose
2. d identified perpendicular lines for small triangles
3.h  roof of house is horizontal, corresponds to vertical line
4.e  rotated images horizontal roof corresponds vertical line
5.c  cosine
6.b
7.g
8.a  zebra lines peerpendicular lines
