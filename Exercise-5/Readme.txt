In the process of identifying corresponding objects within an image using the Fourier transform, I observe objects wth sharp edges in the image and try to identify strong frequencies generated perpendicular to the prominent edges in the original image. These strong perpendicular frequencies can serve as distinctive markers for identification.
1. f identified strong edges near the nose
2. d identified a vertical line (corresponds to horizontal lines in the image2 ), also two tilted parallel lines.
3.h  roof of house is horizontal, corresponds to the vertical line in fourier transform. Also, in the image we have roof of the 2 windows, each creates 2 more tilted line. 
4.e  image described above is just rotated by 90 degrees. images horizontal roof corresponds vertical line
5.c  original image has several vertical lines, which end up as a strong horizontal line in fourier transform
6.b
7.g
8.a  zebra has many lines, in fourier transfrom we can identify lines perpendicular to zebra's lines
